# National Park Data Structure School Project

C# command line application that processes and manages information about **national parks** using various **data structures**.

## Features
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** to organize national parks by name.
- **Max-Heap** to efficiently retrieve parks with the largest areas.
- **Hash Table** to store and update park details.
- **Word Tree** to analyze word frequency from park descriptions.
- **Sorting Algorithm (Bubble Sort)** for demonstration purposes.

## Data Structures Used
1. **Binary Search Tree (`Tree.cs`)**  
   - Stores national parks sorted by name.
   - Supports insertion, search, and tree traversal.
   - Calculates tree depth.

2. **Max-Heap (`CustomMaxHeap.cs`)**  
   - Maintains a max-heap of parks based on their area size.
   - Allows efficient retrieval of the largest parks.

3. **Hash Table (`Program.cs`)**  
   - Stores parks for quick lookup and modification.
   - Enables updating park declaration dates.

4. **Word Tree (`WordTree.cs`)**  
   - Extracts and counts words from park descriptions.
